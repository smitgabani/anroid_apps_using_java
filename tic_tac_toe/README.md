# Tic Tac Toe game

Create a tic tac toe game using android studio. It is a simple game with only game functionality. Has a single screen but can start the game again using startActivity(current). Where current is the only intent (main intent)

I have used a my_board (2d array) as the data structure to save the game board. After every move made the game checks the data sturucture to see if there is any change in the game status (win, draw)/

All the code is explained in detail through the comments.

Please check out the game UI in assets folder and the game itself is in the tictactoe folder.
